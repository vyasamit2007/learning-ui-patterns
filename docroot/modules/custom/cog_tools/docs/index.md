# Acquia Cog Tools


Welcome to the [Acquia Cog Tools](https://github.com/acquia-pso/cog_tools) documentation site!


## Requirements

Cog Tools is a Drupal 8 module. It requires Drush 9.x to function.


## Generating a Cog theme

Download the cog_tools module.
 
`composer require drupal/cog_tools`
 
Enable the cog_tools module

`drush pm:enable cog_tools`

Create a sub theme with drush.

`drush generate cog`

Drush will provide a series of questions to set options for the generated theme. The only value without a default is the theme name.

Enable your new sub theme. For a theme with the machine name `durian`:

`drush theme:enable durian`


## Command line options

Passing in arguments via the command line:

`drush gen cog --answers '{"name":"Durian", "machine_name": "durian", "base_theme": "classy", "description": "What a nice theme.", "package": "Custom", "build_tasks": "yes", "layouts":"yes", "theme_settings":"yes","style_guide":"yes"}'`

Any answers that are left off here will be asked still, so this could be handy if you have a few options you almost always select.
